# Ochoa Family Stuffing

# Recipe

Dictated from James Ochoa but made originally by Grandma (Juanita) Ochoa

### Serving Size

Fits a 12-20lb bird. There will be leftovers to cook on the side. 

### Ingredients:

- 2 stalks of organic celery, split, cut into bite sized pieces, use all the celery
- 4 bunches of green onions, sliced
- Mushrooms - your choice, pulled or cut into bit sized pieces (James addition, not in original recipe)
- A single bunch of parsley
- 4 sprigs of rosemary, pulled off the stalk and minced
- 12-14 sage leafs
- 6 sprigs of thyme taken off the stalk 
- Salt, pepper to task. Fresh pepper 
- 2 Eggs
- 2 Pans of corn bread, crumbled
- 2 sticks of butter, that you saute the veggies in

### Directions

- Saute the veggies together with the butter until they cook down. Don't over cook.
- Crumble corn bread, pour over veggies, add eggs. Mix, let cool for 5-10 min.
- Mix with hands so that you can feel the moisture. Want the mixture to be moist, more on the wet side than the dry side.
- Stuff inside turkey, both body and neck cavity.

- Put the extras in muffin tins, etc. Bake at 350 for 20-30 min until it rises slightly and a tooth pick comes out clean.
