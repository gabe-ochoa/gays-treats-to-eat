2 cups shio koji
1½ cups (10½ ounces) light brown sugar
1½ cups kosher salt
1 18-20lb turkey
6 tablespoons room temperature unsalted butter 

### Turkey roast
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
Black pepper
1 bunch thyme sprigs
1 bunch rosemary sprigs

### Turkey glaze
1 tablespoon shio koji, blended
3 tablespoons unsalted butter,

Small handful of hardy herbs (such as sage, rosemary, bay leaves, and/or thyme)

## Prep and cook

### Make the dry brine

Process shio koji in blender until smooth. 

To make the dry brine combine activated shio Koji (wet), salt, sugar in a 4:3:3 ratio.

Use 1 cup activated (wet) shio Koji per 10lbs of meet.

Reserve 3 tablespoons blended shio koji in airtight container in refrigerator for the glaze. Transfer remaining blended shio koji to bowl and add in sugar and salt.

### Prep and brine the turkey

Spatchcock the turkey. Coat in the dry brine. Refrigerate overnight in the fridge for at least 12 hours or up to 16 hours. Pull out 3 hours before cooking to let temperature normalize for more even cooking.

Separate skin from breast, take the room temp butter, and pack the butter between the skin.

Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 400 degrees. Line rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil. Arrange thyme and rosemary sprigs in single layer on rack. Place turkey parts on prepared rack, skin side up, and brush skin with 1 tablespoon oil. Season with pepper.

### Glaze
Melt butter and and aromatic bundle together. Whisk remaining 1 tablespoon blended shio koji until combined; set aside for the glaze.

### Cook

Total cooking time: 2 hours

Pre-heat oven to 475.

Roast for 30 minutes. Brush skin with shio koji–butter glaze, lower oven to 300, and continue to roast for 25 minutes longer. Rotate sheet, glaze, and roast until breast registers 150 degrees F and thighs register 170 degrees F, 25 to 45 minutes.

Removing pieces as they come to temperature transfer turkey to carving board, and let rest for 30 minutes, and carve.
