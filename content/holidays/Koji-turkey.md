# Turkey notes

## Ingredients

For an 18-20lb turkey:

2 cups shio koji
1½ cups (10½ ounces) sugar
1½ cups kosher salt
1 18-20lb turkey
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
3 tablespoons unsalted butter,
melted
6 tablespoons room temperature unsalted butter 

Black pepper
1 bunch thyme sprigs

## Prep and cook

### Make the dry brine

Process shio koji in blender until smooth. 

To make the dry brine combine activated shio Koji (wet), salt, sugar in a 4:3:3 ratio.

Use 1 cup activated (wet) shio Koji per 10lbs of meet.

Reserve 3 tablespoons blended shio koji in airtight container in refrigerator for the glaze. Transfer remaining blended shio koji to bowl and add in sugar and salt.

### Prep and brine the turkey

Spatchcock the turkey. Coat in the dry brine. Refrigerate overnight in the fridge for at least 12 hours or up to 16 hours. Pull out 3 hours before cooking to let temperature normalize for more even cooking.

Whisk melted butter and remaining 1 tablespoon blended shio koji until combined; set aside for the glaze.

Separate skin from breast, soften butter, and pack the butter between the skin.

Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 400 degrees. Line rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil. Arrange thyme sprigs in single layer on rack. 

### Cook

Place turkey parts on prepared rack, skin side up, and brush skin with 1 tablespoon oil. Season with pepper and cover loosely with foil. Roast for 30 minutes. Remove foil and continue to roast for 25 minutes longer. Rotate sheet, brush skin with shio koji–butter mixture and roast until breast registers 150 degrees F and thighs register 170 degrees F, 25 to 45 minutes.

Removing pieces as they come to temperature transfer turkey to carving board, tent with foil, and let rest for 30 minutes.
